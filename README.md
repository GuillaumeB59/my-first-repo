# About myself
## October the 24th, 2020, Covid-0.
I am supposed to write here a few lines about myself.
Here is one.
And this is the second.

Count this one as the fourth.

Some markdown examples for practice:
1. Born in 1974
2. Grew up in Louviers, Eure, France, Europe
3. Currrently living in London, UK, Europe for still a few months. Sigh.
